# What You Need to Proceed

## ‚ùå The Problem
Your IAM user `jianfengren` doesn't have permissions to:
- View access keys (iam:ListAccessKeys - Access Denied)
- Create new access keys
- This is a **permissions issue**, not a navigation issue

## ‚úÖ Solution: Contact the Account Administrator

Since your friend (account owner) provided the login info, they need to help with this:

### Ask Your Friend to Do ONE of These:

#### Option 1: Create Access Keys for You (Recommended)
**Ask your friend to:**
1. Log in to AWS Console with admin privileges
2. Go to IAM ‚Üí Users ‚Üí `jianfengren`
3. Click "Security credentials" tab
4. Click "Create access key"
5. Choose "Command Line Interface (CLI)"
6. Click "Next" ‚Üí "Create access key"
7. **Send you both:**
   - Access Key ID
   - Secret Access Key (only shown once!)

#### Option 2: Grant You IAM Permissions
**Ask your friend to:**
1. Go to IAM ‚Üí Users ‚Üí `jianfengren`
2. Click "Add permissions" ‚Üí "Attach policies directly"
3. Attach one of these policies:
   - `IAMUserChangePassword` (allows changing your own password and access keys)
   - Or a custom policy allowing `iam:CreateAccessKey` and `iam:ListAccessKeys`

#### Option 3: Provide Existing Access Keys
**Ask your friend:**
"Do you already have AWS access keys for the biomixx.net project I can use?"

## Once You Have the Keys

Run these commands:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter when prompted:
- **Access Key ID:** [paste the key your friend provides]
- **Secret Access Key:** [paste the secret key]
- **Region:** `us-west-2` (IMPORTANT!)
- **Output format:** `json`

Then test it:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Then deploy:
```bash
./deploy_to_s3.sh
```

## üÜò Quick Summary

**What to ask your friend:**
> "I need AWS access keys for the biomixx.net bucket in us-west-2 region. Can you create one for user jianfengren and send me the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key?"

Once you have those 2 pieces of information, configuration takes 2 minutes!

## üìù Alternative: Manual Bucket Setup

If you can't get CLI access, your friend could also manually:
1. Create the S3 bucket `biomixx.net` in us-west-2
2. Enable static website hosting
3. Upload files manually through the S3 console

But using AWS CLI is much easier once you have access keys!

**Next step:** Contact your friend for the access keys.
