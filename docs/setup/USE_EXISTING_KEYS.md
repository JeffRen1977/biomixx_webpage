# Using Existing AWS Access Keys

## The Issue
Your IAM user `jianfengren` doesn't have permissions to view or create access keys in the AWS Console. This is a common security practice.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Ask Your Friend for Existing Access Keys
If your friend (who has full AWS access) already has access keys for this account, ask them to share:
- Access Key ID
- Secret Access Key

Then configure AWS CLI with:
```bash
aws configure
```

### Solution 2: Use Root Account (Not Recommended)
If this is your personal AWS account, you might have root credentials. You can create access keys from root:
1. Click your username in the top-right
2. If you see "Account" instead of "Users", you're in root
3. But this is NOT recommended for security

### Solution 3: Have Administrator Create Keys
Ask your friend (AWS account owner) to:
1. Log in to AWS Console as admin
2. Go to IAM → Users → jianfengren
3. Click "Security credentials"
4. Click "Create access key"
5. Share the keys with you

### Solution 4: Check for Existing Configured Keys
Let me create a script to check if you already have AWS configured:
