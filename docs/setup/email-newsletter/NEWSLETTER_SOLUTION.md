# Newsletter Email Collection Solution

## What I've Implemented

Your newsletter form now sends subscription emails to your FormSpree account. Here's what happens:

### Current Flow:
1. User enters email and clicks "Subscribe"
2. Email is sent to your FormSpree account
3. You receive an email with the subscriber's email
4. You can manually add them to your mailing list (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.)

### Benefits of This Approach:
✅ **Simple** - No API setup required
✅ **Reliable** - Works immediately
✅ **Email backup** - You always get notified
✅ **Flexible** - You control where subscribers go

## How to Build Your Mailing List

### Option 1: Manual Collection (Current)
1. Check your FormSpree emails for new subscribers
2. Manually add emails to Mailchimp/Google Sheets
3. Good for low volume (<50 subscribers/month)

### Option 2: Automatic with Mailchimp
See `MAILING_LIST_SETUP.md` for instructions to:
- Set up Mailchimp API integration
- Automatically add subscribers to mailing list
- No manual work required

### Option 3: Google Sheets Integration
FormSpree can automatically save to Google Sheets:
1. Log into FormSpree
2. Go to Settings → Integrations
3. Enable Google Sheets
4. Connect your Google account
5. All emails automatically saved to spreadsheet
